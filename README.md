# lerna-cola-sample

This is a sample application to showcase [Lerna Cola](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/lerna-cola).

To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctrlplusb/lerna-cola-sample
cd lerna-cola-sample
yarn install
yarn run develop
```

Open the application in your choice of editor and make changes to one of the files. Note the auto cascading of updates/restarts through your servers.

Note: this is still a work in progress. It's merely a skeleton as of yet, but I plan to make it a fully fledged application that you can build, develop, and deploy.
